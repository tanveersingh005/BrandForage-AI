## Sample Prompts (3 Examples)

### 1. Component Architecture
**Prompt**: "Create a responsive React dashboard component with glassmorphism design, featuring a hero section, features grid, pricing cards, and testimonials. Use Tailwind CSS for styling and include smooth hover animations."

**AI Response**: Generated complete component structure with modern design patterns, responsive breakpoints, and interactive elements.

### 2. Animation Implementation
**Prompt**: "Help me implement smooth scroll animations for the features section using Framer Motion. Include entrance animations, hover effects, and staggered animations for the feature cards."

**AI Response**: Provided Framer Motion implementation with `motion.div`, `variants`, and `staggerChildren` for smooth, professional animations.

### 3. Problem Resolution
**Prompt**: "I'm getting a build error: 'use' is not exported from 'react' (imported as 'React5'). How can I fix this React Router DOM compatibility issue?"

**AI Response**: Identified React Router DOM v7 compatibility issues, suggested downgrading to v6.20.1, and provided step-by-step resolution process.
